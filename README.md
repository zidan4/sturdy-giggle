This is a C++ example that fetches data from an API using cURL (a popular library for making HTTP requests). This code demonstrates how to perform a simple GET request to fetch data from a public API (like a JSON placeholder) and parse the response.

Before running this, make sure libcurl is installed on your system (sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev on Linux or use a package manager like Homebrew on macOS).
